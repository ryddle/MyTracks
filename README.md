# MyTracks
Fork from justin66 that is a copy from the last Google My Tracks open source mercurial repo.

At the time of writing Google's old open source My Tracks project lives here: 
https://code.google.com/p/mytracks/

Code is licensed under Apache License 2.0 and content is licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0.

Creation of this fork was occasioned by Google's announcement that its Mercurial repos are going away at some point.
